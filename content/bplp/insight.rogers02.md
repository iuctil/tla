Telehealth visits escalated during the early and worst days of the pandemic during the spring and summer of 2020. And many states, along with the CDC, temporarily waived the rules requiring clinicians to hold a valid license in the state where their patient is located. This would all seem to make the most common of sense.  But by summer of 2021, some states rolled back those waivers, just as the Delta variant was causing surges in many states.
As the [National Emergency Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN)](https://www.tatrc.org/netccn/) provides surge support where requested across the country, the issue of licensing has now become a stress point. Medical licensing among doctors, nurses and other medical professionals has long been a state-run activity. With the advent of telemedicine and the ability to connect patients in one location with a doctor who might be tens or hundreds or thousands of miles distant, the need for flexibility as well as changes from state-only to cross-state licensing agreements has risen to the forefront.
There are state compacts as well as waivers that allow for cross-state medical care by licensed professionals, but it can be difficult to keep up with changing laws, regulations, and waivers. Weâ€™ve conducted some initial research into websites from credible organizations that provide current information on these compacts, agreements, and waivers and have curated an annotated list of resources that provide information on the current state of affairs.
